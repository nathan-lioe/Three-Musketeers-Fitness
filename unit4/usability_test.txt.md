# **Usability Testing Writeup**

## **Introduction**

We conducted a usability study to evaluate the early paper prototypes for two proposed features for app: a **Leaderboard with challenges** and a **Mood-Based Playlist**. These features are not yet implemented on the live site and were tested using Figma prototypes. The goal was to identify usability challenges and gather feedback for improvements prior to development. Two participants were recruited to interact with the prototypes.

Before beginning the test, we introduced ourselves and explained that their role was to act as users interacting with these new features. We asked them to verbalize their thoughts while navigating the prototype and reminded them to speak aloud as they made decisions and interpreted the interface.

## **Tasks**

Each participant was given two separate scenarios, one for each feature:

### **Task 1: Leaderboard with challenges**

**Scenario:** Imagine you want to view how your step count compares to others in the community and start a new challenge focusing on a 7 day builder. Try to find and view the leaderboard and start a new challenge.

### **Task 2: Mood-Based Playlist**

**Scenario:** Imagine you are feeling a certain way (e.g., happy, sad, relaxed) and want to listen to a playlist that matches your mood. Try to find and use the mood-based playlist feature.

We instructed them to let us know when they felt they had successfully completed each task.

## **Notes**

Observations from participant interactions:

### **Leaderboard Feature**

* **Participant 1** hesitated when locating the leaderboard, initially mistaking it for the activity section. Which led nothing to happen. Eventually they found it in the challenge button. When trying to start the specific challenge of a 7 day builder. They tried clicking on the text, but nothing happened. They had to click on the join button so that it led them to the other page. The participant was wondering if there was a way to view the content of the other pages without needing to mark the current day as complete.  
* **Participant 2** found the challenges button easily. When they joined the challenge it led them to the specific challenge page. They were trying to find a back button, but there was none. They were not sure how to go back and asked for assistance. Eventually they clicked the Challenges button to go back.

### **Mood-Based Playlist Feature**

* **Participant 1** commented that the current design lacked nuance and suggested that energy level might impact the music they want to hear within the same mood.  
* **Participant 2** suggested visual icons for moods to make the interface more engaging and intuitive.

## **Feedback**

After completing the tasks, we asked the participants:

1. How easy or difficult was it to complete the task?  
2. What confusions did you encounter?  
3. What could be improved?

### **Participant Responses**

* "It wasn’t immediately clear where the leaderboard was. I thought it might be under ‘My Activity."  
* “When joining a challenge I tried clicking on the text, but it did not go”.  
* “I hope to be able to view all days of challenge”.  
* “I wish that there was a back button when in the challenges page”.  
* "The playlist idea is great, but I wasn’t sure if I had done it correctly since the screen didn’t confirm my mood selection."  
* "Maybe use icons for moods? That could be more fun."  
* "There needs to be more nuance than just 'Happy'—sometimes I’m happy but tired. That should affect the playlist."

## **Results**

### **Leaderboard and Challenges Feature**

**Issues Identified:**

* Confusion locating the leaderboard.  
* Expectation of a back button  
* Expectation of being able to join challenge when clicking text  
* Wanting to view more information for other challenge days

**Hypothesized Causes:**

* Poor labeling/navigation structure.  
* Lack of detail/no preview of activities

**Proposed Fixes:**

* Add a clearly labeled "Leaderboard and Challenges" tab in the main menu.  
* Include back buttons  
* Add navigation to be able to click anywhere on challenge to start it  
* Add ability to view more information of challenge	

### **Mood-Based Playlist Feature**

**Issues Identified:**

* Lack of nuance in mood selection   
* Suggested use of visual mood icons for intuitive interface 

**Hypothesized Causes:**

* Limited user personalization options.  
* Lack of interactive or visual cues in prototype.

**Proposed Fixes:**

* Use visual mood icons with labels.  
* Introduce a second input for users to specify their **energy level** on a 1–10 scale after selecting a mood, enabling more personalized playlist generation (e.g., Happy \+ Low Energy, Stressed \+ High Energy).

## **Updates**

We updated our Figma prototypes for both features to incorporate the suggested improvements. These revised versions will be used in the next round of usability testing. The updated prototype links are submitted as:
